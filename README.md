# CLASSIFICATION-PROBLEM-IN-MACHINE-LEARNING
# Breast Cancer Dataset

# Dataset

The Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn is used for this task. The dataset contains data related to diagnostic features of breast cancer cases.

# Key Components

1. Loading and Preprocessing

# Steps Taken:

. Loaded the dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.

. Checked and confirmed no missing values.

. Applied StandardScaler for feature scaling to normalize the data.

# Justification:

Feature scaling is essential for algorithms like SVM and k-NN that are sensitive to feature magnitudes.

# 2. Classification Algorithms Implemented

# The following algorithms were implemented with descriptions and explanations:

Logistic Regression: A linear model suitable for binary classification tasks.

Decision Tree Classifier: Splits data based on feature values.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model combining multiple decision trees.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Finds the optimal hyperplane for separating classes.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Classifies data points based on the majority class of their neighbors.

# 3. Model Comparison

Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Identified the best-performing model based on accuracy.

# Submission

The code and outputs are provided in a Jupyter Notebook. All explanations are included in markdown cells.
